# yocto-scripts

This repo contains scripts that help setup the yocto environment during the build automation.
Therefore, it is not meant to be used directly but rather through the [yocto manifest scripts](https://github.com/flashbots/yocto-manifests).
During initialization phase, this repo will be cloned in the root directory of the source tree setup which later can be executed to complete the setup.
